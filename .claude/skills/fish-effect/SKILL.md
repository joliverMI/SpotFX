  fx/effects/fish.py (Matrix, crystal-mapper) — a schooling/steering fish
  effect behind the Fish scene, built as a wholesale copy of Orbits V2's
  bands/kinds but with completely different kinematics. Load before
  touching swim speed, avoidance, the camera window, wake/trail rendering,
  dispersal, or the swim-burst flare — every one of these has a shipped
  invariant that isn't visible from reading the code cold.

# Fish

Matrix effect renders to `crystal-mapper` — load `crystal-hex-grid` first.
Fish shares Orbits V2's scene data (bands, flare kinds, weightings,
curves — see `scripts/seed_fish_scene.py`) but reuses NONE of Orbits'
motion; treat "Orbits semantics" as a false friend here.

## The speed dial is his ESCAPE HATCH back to smooth motion — not a
   redundant knob, and the defaults are DERIVED, not tuned by eye

`min_drift_speed` (floor, fraction of the old continuous target) +
`stroke_speed_cap` (pulse cap synced to the flap phase) together replace a
single smooth speed target with surge-and-coast thrust. Setting
`min_drift_speed=1, stroke_speed_cap=0` reduces the formula to EXACTLY the
old smooth target, bit for bit (`scripts/check_fish_camera.py` §1b proves
this against the real pre-thrust merge-base) — that's the dial's whole
purpose: a way back to the old feel without touching code.
**The shipped defaults (`min_drift_speed=0.85`, `stroke_speed_cap=0.4`)
are SOLVED, not picked**: a pulse must redistribute speed in time without
changing the average speed across a stroke cycle, so they satisfy
`min_drift_speed + stroke_speed_cap * PULSE_SHAPE_CYCLE_MEAN(0.375) == 1.0`
algebraically. **Changing either shipped default requires re-solving this
equation for the other value**, or you silently reintroduce a mean-speed
regression exactly like the one caught live 2026-09-17 (a rebase surfaced
a 23% slowdown from defaults that hadn't been re-solved). See the THRUST
comment block in `fish.py` itself before touching either number.

## The swim-burst flare ships at `trigger_offset_ms = 0` DELIBERATELY —
   the -100ms he asked for is a KNOWN, deferred gap

He asked for the burst to start 100ms before the trigger; he then
corrected himself — "no, dont pull the band forward, just dont add the
100ms pre-fire" — because a BAND takes the MOST-NEGATIVE offset among all
its attached kinds (`band_trigger_offset_ms`), so an early swim-burst
would drag every OTHER flare on the same band early too. It ships at 0
(fires ON the trigger) and the early start is explicitly deferred to
per-flare-kind lead work (see AGENTS.md's "PER-FLARE TRIGGER MOMENT"
section) — do not "fix" this by giving the kind a negative offset without
first checking whether per-kind independent timing has landed; before
that lands, doing so silently drags every sibling kind on the band early.

## The trail must be fed the UNGAINED body — a scatter/crossfade gain must
   never be deposited into a PERSISTENT decaying buffer

The outgoing-crossfade body gain (up to ~3.33x, `TRANSITION_GAIN_FLOOR`)
compensates for the virtual's additive blend so a departing fish doesn't
visibly dim — but depositing that GAINED value into `self.trail` (a
decaying buffer with MEMORY) compounds: he reported trails "3x too long"
and "50% too big" the same night this shipped. Fix shape: draw the body
ONCE at TRUE brightness into the trail (every future frame's decay/
diffusion governed by that alone), and only while scattering, a SECOND
time at gained brightness maxed against the trail for THAT FRAME's
composited output ONLY — never stored. Generalizes: any effect with a
persistent trail/wake buffer must never let a transient render-time gain
leak into what gets stored for the next frame.

## Fish never fade — they DISPERSE (steer off-panel), full brightness the
   whole way, on a DEADLINE

Every exit (population trim, lull, rush settle, an outgoing crossfade with
no adopting effect) is ONE mode: DISPERSING (`p_mode == 4`) — full
brightness, steered out under the ordinary turn-rate clamp, retired only
once the WHOLE body clears the panel. Speed is DERIVED every frame from
remaining distance-to-clear (never a tuned speed) — this is what lets a
900ms lull and a 6s one both work. Mode 2 (linear fade) now belongs ONLY
to the drop's ejecta.

## The swim burst can push a fish off-screen — a boundary SPEED BRAKE
   exists specifically for burst speed, and it's scoped tightly

The boundary steer converges on a FIXED TIME constant, so a burst-speed
fish can travel far enough during that correction time to clear the panel
edge before its heading catches up — this is NOT predicted by the
turn-radius math (speed-invariant by construction) and was only found by
instrumenting the real pipeline. The fix (`BOUND_BRAKE_AT`/
`BOUND_BRAKE_TAU`) is live ONLY while a swim-burst is active
(`self._burst`/`self._burst_tail`) and only for a fish heading OUTWARD —
ordinary swimming near the edge is completely untouched. Don't widen its
trigger condition without re-running `scripts/check_fish_camera.py`'s
byte-identity guard on ordinary swimming.

## Everything else worth knowing before a change

- **Body follows the RECORDED PATH, not a bend model**: the front half of
  the spine points the current heading; the rear half is walked back
  along a per-fish recorded path (world-space, pushed by real travel
  distance, never time-sampled) — a straight swim reduces to the old
  rigid stick exactly.
- **Mutual avoidance is STEERING ONLY**, forward-arc, bounded by the same
  turn-rate clamp as everything else, and OFF during the charge's school
  and the drop's rush (authored choreography, not crowds to fix).
- **`camera_follow` is a WINDOW, not a world remap** — at `camera_follow=0`
  the mapping is the identity (byte-identical to the pre-camera baseline,
  proven against a pinned git ref, `BASELINE_REF` in
  `scripts/check_fish_camera.py` — pin a NEW reference when a mechanic
  changes the render at knob-zero, never let a moving `master` ref
  silently retire the proof to a skip).
- **A pulse/thrust config disagreement between the effect's own docstring
  math and the shipped defaults is the class of bug to watch for** — the
  2026-09-17 mean-speed regression is the cautionary tale; re-derive, don't
  eyeball.
- **`p_nocap`/school/rush exemptions are scoped**, same shape as
  blackhole's — don't widen without a fresh ask.

## Sonic reach

The `swim_burst` flare kind IS Sonic-editable via `set_flare_kind`
(`trigger_offset_ms`, `hold_ms`, `params`, `gain` are all omit-means-keep)
— this is the one fish control Sonic can reach directly, because it's a
FlareKind, not a raw effect param. Every other param here follows the
usual rule: no direct edit, only through an attached FlareKind.

## Executable proofs

`scripts/check_fish.py`, `check_fish_avoidance.py`, `check_fish_lunge.py`,
`check_fish_camera.py`, `check_fish_wake.py`, `check_fish_charge_spread.py`,
`check_fish_burst_bounds.py`, `check_fish_disperse.py`,
`tests/test_fish.py`, `test_fish_camera.py`, `test_fish_disperse.py`.
History: AGENTS.md's "Fish (fx/effects/fish.py) — Orbits' twin" section —
read that in full before a non-trivial change; it documents ~8 more
PR-scoped fixes (lunge envelope, charge spread, camera window centring,
wake replacement) each with its own measured-not-assumed proof.
